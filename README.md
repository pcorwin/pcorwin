I'm a software and data engineer using Python and machine learning toolkits to solve problems! When I'm not doing this, I enjoy making repositories for self-education in whatever topic I'm curious about. Most repositories are works-in-progress, as I frequently circle back to different ideas with improvements or new questions. Feel free to reach out on LinkedIn if you have any questions ðŸ˜„
